# Setup & Requirements
You require running [cardano-db-sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync) for the API to be able to retrieve data
live from the blockchain. If you do not want to set up or maintain your own infrastructure, you will soon be able to use [adagate.io](https://adagate.io) services.

# Configuration
You must provide a configuration file in the following format in order to define the database connection parameters.
It will also allow you to define how many worker verticles will be deployed interacting with the database (for parallel execution).
The default location is defined in the <a href="https://github.com/adagate-io/adagate-api/blob/main/pom.xml#L110" target="_blank"><code>pom.xml</code></a> file.

```
{
  "network": "mainnet|testnet",
  "workers": 3,
  "workerPoolSize": 20,
  "http": {
    "port": <api_port>
  },
  "database": {
    "host": "<localhost>",
    "port": <db_port>,
    "name": "<cexplorer by default>",
    "user": "<db_username>",
    "pw": "<db_passwd>"
  }
}
```

# Run
Generally, you can execute the `run.sh` script in the root directory to start the application. 
But a system service is the recommended way.

## Run Locally
A simple local port forwarding can be used to create a connection to your remote machine hosting the blockchain database.

`ssh -L 5555:127.0.0.1:5432 <username>@<server_ip>`

Thereby the port `5555` should be matching the `<db_port>` defined in the configuration.
